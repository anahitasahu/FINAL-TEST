# Product Critique by Anahita Sahu

Overall, very easy UX and clear instructions. Needs some prior familiarity with Github. Would love to understand how this works for a non-technical audience

### 3 things I love

- Repeated instructions, especially with copy-paste code blocks
- Seamless integration with github
- Great use and positioning of starter template

<Tip>The breaking down of elements into copy-paste code blocks is great!</Tip>

### 3 things I didn't love

- Need to know github, lots of minor technical set-up processes
- Need to go into code to format or customize text and color
- Confused by how structuring works given Githube code is just stacked one after the other
